# Intro
In this repository you can find a few websites I created to dive a bit into html, css, javascript, typescript and vue.js. 

# Resources
  ### < HTML & CSS >
  [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been my Bible.
  
  ### < Web design >
  
  From  [Sajid](https://www.youtube.com/@whosajid) I recommend:

  The visuals and edit of the videos speak for themselves. The information is straight to the point, clear and super helpful!

  From [Self-Made Web Designer](https://www.youtube.com/@SelfMadeWebDesigner) I also recommend:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyomWr_C_jA&list=PL-iwwQA26tlFecnT2HMip8gigYBWz9Q1X&index=54
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRFD6tENX2U&list=PL-iwwQA26tlFecnT2HMip8gigYBWz9Q1X&index=57
    
  The visuals are more colorful and sophisticated but the information is really well organized and documented. Great tips.
